# ice-score

## Description

ICE stands for 'Impact', 'Confidence', and 'Ease':

* The positive impact it would have if it succeeds.
* The confidence you have that it will succeed if you try it.
* How easy it would be to try it.

When you have many tasks that need prioritization, score on a scale of 1-10 these three variables for each task. Then to get its ICE Score, average its three numbers.

This model is perfect to make short-term decisions.

## Mirage JS

It's an easy API mocking library that I use to simulate API responses by writing route handlers. And it also has a simple in-memory database which I can interact with in my route handlers.

Mirage resets its state on every browser reload. So, data will reset to its initial state.

I use Axios to consume API.
